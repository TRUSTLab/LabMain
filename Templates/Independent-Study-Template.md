# Independent Study Objective

Use this section to state your objectives in the independent study, objectives should include active
descriptions of what you will accomplish, e.g.: after this independent study I will:

* Be proficient with SQL databases and their usage to store large data sets.
* Be able to apply data cleaning tools such as the BeautifulSoup Python package and OpenRefine
* Implement algorithm X for the study of Y.
* ...

# Independent Study Plan Narrative Description

Use this section to describe your plan for the independent study.  It should relate to your independent
study objectives, and list major due dates and checkpoints for progress.
Use *action verbs*
to specify *demonstrable* and *measurable* outcomes for these objectives.  Good objectives are *meaningful,
measurable, distinctive, and aligned/consistent* with your plan of work for the trimester.  Good verbs
are ones like *compile, identify, create, plan, revise, analyze, design, select, utilize, apply, demonstrate,
use, explain, predict, assess, compare, critique, outline,* or *evaluate.*

# Deliverables for Semester

Set your concrete deliverables for the semester.  Concrete deliverables all have outcomes which can be shared as a document and include reports, test results, code, demonstrations, notes, etc.

# Risks and Mitigations

List the major risks to forward progress, followed by your plans to mitigate these risks.  Identify
possible challenges to your work and show you have thought out how to make progress when you encounter
these challenges.

* **Risk**: My proposed algorithm may not perform better than the state of the art.
* **Mitigation**: I will fully profile the execution time, identify the bottlenecks encountered by both
my algorithm and the state of the art, and provide an analysis of how to overcome these challenges.  I
will give good theoretical background for my assumptions.
* **Risk**: Data set X may not support the analysis we intend to perform because of Y, and Z.
* **Mitigation**: Alternative data sets Q, R, and S are also available, though they are less ideal due to
T, I propose altering my analysis with U to account for these difficulties.
