# Weekly Progress Reports

In order to help students continue to make progress, and to help inform them of potential insufficient or unsatisfactory progress in advance of the trimester review, each student will have a weekly meeting with PI Dr. Eric Rozier. During this meeting discussion will be about progress over the prior week, road blocks to progress, questions, and schedules.

**Before meeting all students are required to fill out and send a [Weekly Progress Report](../Templates/WeeklyReport-Template.md). Failure to send this report at least 24 hours in advance of the scheduled weekly meeting will lead to the cancelation of the meeting.** These meetings are important for your progress, and expected on a weekly basis. If the PI is unavailable during a given week, the meeting will be rescheduled as appropriate, but the weekly report is still expected by the original due date. If you need to reschedule a meeting due to a conflict, you should do so at the earliest possible date. **Missing two or more meetings during a semester without prior approval can constitute Unsatisfactory Progress.**

Weekly progress reports are designed to help students understand their progress towards trimester, program, and assistantship
goals, and to help clear road blocks and mitigate risks which are encountered during the natural course of scientific
discovery.  Science involves exploring the unknown, nothing ever goes smoothly.  The key to a successful scientific career
involves meticulous note taking, record keeping, and planning.

## Organization

Weekly reports will be committed to the lab-wide repository at: https://github.com/TRUSTLab/LabInternal

You will find the current directory structure:
```
GRAReports/
HonorsReports/
IndependentStudyReports/
UGRAReports/
```

Each folder serves as a repository for Graduate Research Assistants, Honors students, Independent Study students, and Undergraduate Research Assistants respectively.  Within the appropriate top-level folder create a new subfolder with your username, for example a new PhD student would create:

```
GRAReports/
	↳ username/
```

Within your username's directory create a subdirectory for every new month, when it occurs in the format `YYYY-MM` so September of 2025 would be `2025-09`.  Name your weekly reports using the scheme `username-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.  So if your meeting was on September 8th, 2025, on September 7th, or before, you would create a file `username-2025-09-08.md` in the appropriate directory with your weekly report:

```
GRAReports/
	↳ username/
	  ↳ 2025-09/
	    ↳ username-2025-09-08.md
```
