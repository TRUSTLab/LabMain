# What We Stand For

The Trustworthy Data Engineering Laboratory is committed to advancing the current state of
the art in Computer Science, Data Science, and Data Engineering by addressing problems at
the confluence of data, analytics, infrastructure, privacy, and social good.  We are made up of
a mixture of professional and volunteers from diverse backgrounds, working on every aspect of our mission
- including mentorship, education, and connection people to solutions in this important area of work.

Our long-term, overarching, and unifying goal is to enable people to overcome problems they face in
data and computing, and to ensure that our lab members enter the world better equipped to handle the
challenges of our profession, and to leave a positive societal impact with their work.  Membership in the lab
provides you with the opportunity to learn; to work on important, challenging, and unique projects;
and to meet a lot of people who share your interests and goals.  As a lab our core cultural values are:

* **Professionalism.** During your tenure at the lab you will be working with industrial partners,
scientific colleagues, NGOs, non-profits, government institutions, and other project partners.  You will also be
presenting your work to the general public and scientific community.  In all of these capacities you are acting as a
representative of our lab, COM S, and ISU.  We expect you to be professional and respectful in all dealings with partners,
the public, and other lab members.
* **Being open-minded.** Our lab brings together people from different backgrounds, and with different skills.  Share your
knowledge and experience with one another.  Be patient when teaching one another, and keep an open ear, and open mind for new
ideas and approaches.  Scientific progress comes from pushing the limits and trying new ideas which are grounded in solid
theory.
* **Resourcefulness and pragmatism.** All members are expected to own their own learning experience, and seek out resources
as necessary.  Do not be shy to ask for help when you are stuck, but be mindful of the time of others - tell them what you
do not understund, where you are stuck, and what you have tried.  Do your due diligence in making sure what you are asking
isn't easily found with a google search, or by reading the documentation.
* **Maturity.** Conflicts happen in any environment.  It is acceptable, and even expected, to encounter conflicts with
fellow lab members, your mentors, or members of COM S and ISU.  We ask all members to be productive, pragmatic, and mature
when dealing with conflicts.  Assume good faith, keep an open mind, listen, and communicate with everyone involved.  Remember
that everyone has a lot invested in the lab, and we want everyone to be happy and productive.
* **Personal responsibility.** Being a member of the lab is a big commitment, and requires work during the entire year.
All lab members are expected to be in the office five days a week, and to attend lab-wide sessions, seminars, and events.  We
recognize that lab members have a life outside of the lab, and encourage a work-life balance.  Any potential absences must
be discussed, approved, and agreed upon prior to their occurance.
* **Contentiousness.** Our lab has many shared spaces, both within the lab, and with the University.  It is everybody's job to keep these spaces free of messes, and clean.
* **Stewardship.** As a member of the community we are all expected to stay involved with the work we produce, to present
the work at conferences and symposia, to assist in writing up research results for publications, and to maintain code and
documentation.
