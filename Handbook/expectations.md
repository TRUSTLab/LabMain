# Expectations

All lab members are expected to make satisfactory progress in two main areas:

* Their degree or program of study.
* The deliverables and objectives of their assistantship.

Members of the lab are expected to work a minimum of 20 hours a week towards their degree or program of study, including
course work, examinations, qualifications, and progress on their thesis research and professional publications; and to work
contribute 20 hours a week towards the deliverables and objectives of their assistantship (if applicable).  Graduate
school is a full time job, and requires constant progress and a good work ethic to be successful.  Ideally your work will
overlap between your assistantship and program of study, but this is not always the case.  When overlap does occur you should
expect to contribute a full 40 hours a week towards this joint work.

## Satisfactory Progress

Satisfactory progress towards both of these two main areas will be evaluated three times yearly with your advisor in the
laboratory, using a progress of trimester planning and evaluation.  At the beginning of each trimester (corresponding to the
Fall, Spring, and first Summer sessions of the academic year) you will meet with your advisor and complete a trimester
plan using the following [template](../master/Templates/TrimesterPlan-Template.md).  If you have been with the lab for more
than one trimester, you will also review progress and goals from the last trimester, and you will be evaluated by the lab
PI, Dr. Eric Rozier, who will give you a rating of **Satisfactory Progress**, **Insufficient Progress**, or **Unsatisfactory Progress**.  A rating of **Satisfactory** indicates your performance has met or exceeded expectations.  **Insufficient**
indicates and acknowledges that some progress was made, but insufficient to maintain the proposed plan of study, or
for the objectives of the assistantship.  Two trimesters with insufficient progress is grounds for dismissal at the
discretion of the PI.  In the case of insufficient progress the next trimester plan should include concrete objectives and
deliverables to not only continue progress, but remediate insufficient progress.  **Unsatisfactory** ratings indicate
that progress was not evident, and is grounds for immediate dismissal.

## Weekly Meetings

In order to help students continue to make progress, and to help inform them of potential insufficient or unsatisfactory
progress in advance of the trimester review, each student will have a weekly meeting with PI Dr. Eric Rozier.  During
this meeting discussion will be about progress over the prior week, road blocks to progress, questions, and schedules.

**Before meeting all students are required to fill out and send a [Weekly Progress Report](../master/Templates/WeeklyReport-Template.md)**.  **Failure to send this report at least 24 hours in advance of the scheduled weekly meeting will lead to the
cancelation of the meeting.**  These meetings are important for your progress, and expected on a weekly basis.  If the PI
is unavailable during a given week, the meeting will be rescheduled as appropriate, but the weekly report is still expected
by the original due date.  If you need to reschedule a meeting due to a conflict, you should do so at the earliest possible
date.  **Missing two or more meetings during a semester without prior approval can constitute Unsatisfactory Progress.**
