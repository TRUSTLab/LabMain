# Vacation, Time-off, and Leave

Graduate students and members of the lab are expected to continue to make forward progress on their research at all times.
Students are expected to make a minimum of 20 hours of progress towards their degree requirements a week, and 20 hours
of progress towards deliverables and objectives dictated by their assistantships.  Graduate students do not accrue sick leave or vacation hours, and the ISU graduate student handbook states:

> Arrangement for a leave of absence is made between the graduate assistant and that assistant’s supervisor adhering to all grant and other funding source restrictions. When a graduate assistant needs to be absent either for personal reasons or illness, the supervisor should be understanding and accommodating to that need. At the same time, the graduate assistant should attempt to plan personal leave so that it does not interfere with or cause neglect of the duties associated with his or her appointment. Supervisors of graduate assistants are responsible for ensuring that their assistants do not exceed reasonable limits for leave.

> When a conflict arises between the graduate assistant and that assistant’s supervisor regarding leave of absence use, either party may involve the appropriate Director of Graduate Education (DOGE). If the conflict is not resolved in a timely manner, any of the parties may involve the Dean of the Graduate College for a binding resolution. When resolving conflicts, the concerned party must present all evidence in writing (email is acceptable) and all parties involved must receive a copy. In order to accommodate schedules, allow a minimum of five business days for document review and resolution meeting to be scheduled between the two parties within two weeks. Resolutions achieved between the DOGE and parties need to be in writing (email is acceptable) and must be sent to all parties including the Dean of the Graduate College.

Further clarification on leave policy is offered by ISU's policy library:

> Arrangements for a leave of absence are made between the graduate assistant and that assistant's supervisor. When a graduate student employee needs to be absent either for personal reasons or illness, the supervisor should be understanding and accommodating to that need. At the same time, the graduate assistant should attempt to plan personal leave so that it does not interfere with or cause neglect of the duties associated with his or her appointment. Supervisors of graduate assistants are responsible for ensuring that their assistants do not exceed reasonable limits for leave.
