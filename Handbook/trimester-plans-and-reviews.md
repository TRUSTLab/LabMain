# Trimester Plans and Reviews

Each trimester period, corresponding to the Fall, Spring, and first Summer sessions of the academic year,
will commence with a special meeting with your advisor to complete a [trimester plan](../Templates/TrimesterPlan-Template.md).  If you have been with the lab for more than one trimester, you will also review progress and goals from the last trimester, and you will be evaluated by the lab PI, Dr. Eric Rozier, who will give you a rating of Satisfactory Progress, Insufficient Progress, or Unsatisfactory Progress. A rating of Satisfactory indicates your performance has met or exceeded expectations. Insufficient indicates and acknowledges that some progress was made, but insufficient to maintain the proposed plan of study, or for the objectives of the assistantship. Two trimesters with insufficient progress is grounds for dismissal at the discretion of the PI. In the case of insufficient progress the next trimester plan should include concrete objectives and deliverables to not only continue progress, but remediate insufficient progress. Unsatisfactory ratings indicate that progress was not evident, and is grounds for immediate dismissal.

The purpose of this plan is to set expectations for the coming trimester, manage and understand program and assistantship
goals and expectations, and to build a plan of work for the coming period.  The trimester plan should serve as a planning
document for your weekly reports, and help to guide you towards satisfactory progress.  Completing a graduate degree
requires planning for years in advance with unknown outcomes and is a difficult process.  Learning to plan properly
not only ensures success, but builds skills in project and grant management which are necessary for a successful career
as a research scientist or engineer.
