# Code of Conduct for Laboratory Members and Guests

The Trustworthy Data Engineering Laboratory is committed to providing a safe and professional environment
for all lab members, guests, and colleagues.  We pride ourselves on our welcoming environment
for free discussion of ideas.  We do not tolerate harassment of any members of our community in any form.

## What constitutes harassment?
Harassment includes—but is not limited to—unwelcome conduct or offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, or religion; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, unwelcome or unauthorized photography or recording,sustained disruption, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Similarly, encouraging others to engage in such behavior is not permitted, nor are false accusations of harassment.

## Who is covered under this Code of Conduct?

All members of the lab and lab guests are required to refrain from harassment.  Lab members will
enforce this Code in all lab functions and spaces and expect cooperation.  Members should avoid sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing, uniforms, or costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

The Lab also requests that lab members refrain from using potentially offensive language in social media posts using laboratory, department, or university hashtags.

## How should I handle an uncomfortable situation?

Interpersonal Behavior: If it is safe to do so, we encourage you to request that the person stop the unwelcome or harassing behavior. Members who are asked to stop any such behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any related concerns, please contact
PI Dr. Eric Rozier immediately.  You can also contact department or University staff.
Lab administrators welcome comments of all kinds about talks and presentations. Comments are taken seriously and will be kept in confidence if requested.

## What happens once a report is made?
Interpersonal Behavior: If an incident of harassment is reported, lab, department, or university members will conduct an investigation as appropriate. If they determine—to the best of their ability, and in their sole discretion—that a member has violated this Code, they may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the lab. Under certain circumstances and at their discretion, lab administrators may contact department or university representatives. To protect all parties involved, lab administrators will generally not make any detailed public statements about Code of Conduct incidents.

## This is a living document

The TRUST Lab intends for these policies to meet the needs of our members and we welcome comments and suggestions.
