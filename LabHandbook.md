# TRUSTworthy Data Engineering Laboratory Handbook
## V1.0

In an effort to help new students and laboratory members understand the culture,
expectations, and code of conduct, the lab has decided to publish this handbook.
It's a place where we try to share what you need to know about the TRUST Lab
as a place to work and study, and to understand our history, process, and
the expectations we have of each other in our common pursuit.  This document
is a living document, and subject to change, but we hope it helps clarify our
lab policies, what we stand for, and how we work.  Codifying these beliefs
and policies into a handbook makes them tangible, editable, and less ambigious.
