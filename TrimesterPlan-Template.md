# Objectives for Trimester: Spring 2018

Use this section to set your plan for the next trimester, it should relate to your program goals, and listed
major objectives for your program plan.  What will you accomplish during the next trimester?  Use *action verbs*
to specify *demonstrable* and *measurable* outcomes for these objectives.  Good objectives are *meaningful,
measurable, distinctive, and aligned/consistent* with your plan of work for the trimester.  Good verbs
are ones like *compile, identify, create, plan, revise, analyze, design, select, utilize, apply, demonstrate,
use, explain, predict, assess, compare, critique, outline,* or *evaluate.*

# Deliverables for Trimester: Spring 2018

Set your concrete deliverables for the next trimester.  Concrete deliverables all have outcomes which can be shared as a document and include reports, test results, code, demonstrations, notes, etc.

# Risks and Mitigations

List the major risks to forward progress, followed by your plans to mitigate these risks.  Identify
possible challenges to your work and show you have thought out how to make progress when you encounter
these challenges.

* **Risk**: My proposed algorithm may not perform better than the state of the art.
* **Mitigation**: I will fully profile the execution time, identify the bottlenecks encountered by both
my algorithm and the state of the art, and provide an analysis of how to overcome these challenges.  I
will give good theoretical background for my assumptions.
* **Risk**: Data set X may not support the analysis we intend to perform because of Y, and Z.
* **Mitigation**: Alternative data sets Q, R, and S are also available, though they are less ideal due to
T, I propose altering my analysis with U to account for these difficulties.

# Analysis of Progress

Use this section to discuss your progress since the last trimester.  Which objectives did you meet?
Which did you not?  Which deliverables did you meet?  Which did you not?  Why did you meet, or miss your
goals?  How does this impact your plan?  If you missed objectives or deliverables, how do you propose
recovering?
